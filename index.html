          Most people choose to come during the winter because the weather is quite cozy. I had been here many times but
          hardly went to tourist attractions.
          I dislike packed venues, and that's really unnecessary.
          That being said, the only thing you need to do here is be laid-back.
          So I spent all day staying in the hotel and went to the beach around dusk.</span></div>
